--->SETUP<---------------------------------------------------------------
The following packages are required and need to be installed on your system. For installation instructions for there packages please consult the python library installation procedure for your operating system.

Package Requirements:
        python
        python-nltk
        nltk-data
        pyenchant

After extracting the archived files enter the project directory. After placing the intended essay files in the test directory, navigate to the projects root root directory and run the "run.py" script file with your python interpreter. 

Example:
        "python run.py"

--->TECHNIQUE<-----------------------------------------------------------

Quoted from the sourcecode:

## Illegal Combinations: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/sv_agr.htm
## Basic Principle: Singular subjects need singular verbs; plural subjects need plural verbs.
## My brother is a nutritionist. My sisters are mathematicians.
## So we are counting errors for:
##  VBP / VBZ followed by NNS / NNPS
## We can't check for verb plural using the tags existing.

# attempt to do stats on the verb tenses, mainly check if there is a main verb and see if all verbs in a sentence are the same tense
# a sentence must have a least 1 VB* for it to count as having a main verb
# verb of different tenses will trigger an error, a mix including VB is not being counted as an error due toa noticed pattern in the tagging
# split loops for logic separation

# No verb then no main verb, no main verb error

Checking error numbers after that for the 'low', 'medium' and 'high' levels with mins and maxes creates ranges in which the grading works based on the training documents.

--->TODO<----------------------------------------------------------------

Take verb usage into scoring account, stats grabbed from training but not used for tests
