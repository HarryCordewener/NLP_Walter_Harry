--->TECHNIQUE<-----------------------------------------------------------

Quoted from the sourcecode:

## Illegal Combinations: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/sv_agr.htm
## Basic Principle: Singular subjects need singular verbs; plural subjects need plural verbs.
## My brother is a nutritionist. My sisters are mathematicians.
## So we are counting errors for:
##  VBP / VBZ followed by NNS / NNPS
## We can't check for verb plural using the tags existing.

# attempt to do stats on the verb tenses, mainly check if there is a main verb and see if all verbs in a sentence are the same tense
# a sentence must have a least 1 VB* for it to count as having a main verb
# verb of different tenses will trigger an error, a mix including VB is not being counted as an error due toa noticed pattern in the tagging
# split loops for logic separation

# No verb then no main verb, no main verb error

Checking error numbers after that for the 'low', 'medium' and 'high' levels with mins and maxes creates ranges in which the grading works based on the training documents.
